# MFM_indicator
MFM indicator using pnadas instead of Numpy
inspiration for this was https://medium.com/swlh/creating-a-trading-strategy-from-scratch-in-python-fe047cb8f12
I eneded up writing it using pandas instead of numpy. I like numpy but pandas is easier for me. I am hoping to use the indicator on a selection of ETF's
Would like to see if this catches the move and if we sold put or calls if we would get they would be excersised.
